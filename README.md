# AlbumsApp lbs technical test

# Configuration of project
First Configuration needed in this project is fetching tag because the version of code and other elements are based on the tag value.
In buildSrc there is a list of dependency that i have not used in the project. the reason of add them is to show the technical stack that i'am using usually in projects

# Still to do
I have not the time to do:

1. Handling networking execptions and displaying errors in the view
2. i started working in test units and androidTest in a branch named add_android_tests but is not finished.

If there is any questions don't hesitate to cameback for me on youssef.lagrouh1@gmail.com.
